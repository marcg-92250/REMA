# KuaiRec 2.0 Recommender System

## Dataset Overview

The KuaiRec 2.0 dataset consists of interactions between users and videos from the Kuaishou platform, and it includes the following components:

- **Interaction Data**:
  - `small_matrix.csv` (~4.7M rows)
  - `big_matrix.csv` (~12.5M rows)
  - Key columns: `user_id`, `video_id`, `watch_ratio`, and timestamps.

- **Item Information**:
  - `item_categories.csv` which contains categorical features for each video.

- **User Information**:
  - `user_features.csv` which contains activity-related features and demographics for each user.

## Approach

### Labeling Criteria

We derived implicit feedback labels from the `watch_ratio`:

- `label = 1` if the `watch_ratio â‰¥ 0.7` (indicating a positive interaction).
- `label = 0` otherwise (indicating a negative interaction).

This threshold was chosen to represent highly engaged interactions, where users watched at least 70% of the video's total duration.

### Data Filtering

To ensure more reliable recommendations:

- We retained only users with at least 3 positive interactions.
- We kept only items (videos) with at least 3 positive interactions.

This filtering process helps to remove sparse data and ensures the interactions are meaningful.

### Train/Test Split

We applied a leave-n-out strategy to split the data:

- For each user, 20% of their positive interactions were randomly held out for testing.
- For training, we sampled 8 unseen items for each positive interaction.
- For testing, we sampled up to 99 unseen items for each held-out interaction (configurable via `test_neg_ratio`).

This ensures a personalized evaluation per user, making the testing scenario more robust and challenging.

## Model Settings

### Baseline Model (LightFM)

- **Architecture**: Matrix factorization with WARP (Weighted Approximate-Rank Pairwise) loss.
- **Embedding size**: 256-dimensional embeddings.
- **Learning rate**: 0.03.
- **Regularization**: `alpha = 0.0005` for both user and item embeddings.
- **Max sampled**: 150 negative samples per training step.
- **Input**: Only user-item interactions (no additional features).
- **Early stopping**: Patience of 5 to 8 evaluations.
- **Training duration**: 100 to 300 epochs (configurable).

## Evaluation Protocol

### Evaluation Metrics

We evaluated the baseline model on various ranking metrics:

- **Precision@k**: The fraction of recommended items that are relevant.
- **Recall@k**: The fraction of relevant items that are recommended.
- **F1@k**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall.
- **NDCG@k**: Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain, which emphasizes the rank of relevant items.
- **Item Coverage@10**: Percentage of total items that appear in any user's top-10 recommendations.
- **Diversity@10**: Measures the diversity of the recommended items by calculating the average pairwise distance between item embeddings.

The evaluation was performed on the held-out test set for each user.

## Conclusions

1. The baseline model's performance was evaluated using several ranking metrics, and it demonstrated consistent results across the Precision, Recall, and F1 scores.
   
2. The implemented WARP loss in the matrix factorization model effectively optimized for ranking tasks, making it a suitable choice for implicit feedback scenarios, like video recommendations.

3. The data preprocessing and filtering strategy significantly improved the recommendation quality by ensuring that users and items with too few interactions were excluded from training.

4. The evaluation covered a comprehensive set of metrics, both for accuracy (Precision, Recall, F1, NDCG) and beyond-accuracy measures (Coverage, Diversity), providing a holistic view of the recommendation quality.

5. The inclusion of early stopping allowed for optimized training duration without sacrificing performance, ensuring efficient model training.

6. The careful handling of user and item features during preprocessing, such as the use of scaling for numerical features, prevented overfitting by ensuring that no single feature dominated the model.

## Future Directions

- **Watch Ratio Sensitivity**: Experiment with varying thresholds for the `watch_ratio` to study the effect of different definitions of positive interactions.
  
- **Sequential Recommendation**: Incorporate temporal patterns by exploring sequential recommendation models that capture changes in user preferences over time.

- **Session-based Recommendations**: Consider implementing session-based recommendation techniques that capture users' short-term preferences based on recent interactions.

- **Neural Network Models**: Explore neural network-based approaches like Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) or Variational Autoencoders (VAE) as alternatives to matrix factorization.

- **Cross-validation**: Implement cross-validation to assess the model's generalizability and ensure more robust comparison of model variants.

- **Feature Exploration**: Consider incorporating content-based features such as metadata about the videos (e.g., genre, description) to further improve recommendation accuracy.

- **A/B Testing**: Implement A/B testing to validate the model's effectiveness in real-world environments.
